          <h2>Chinatowns are suffering during the pandemic.</h2>
          <p class="lead">The restaurant industry is essential to New York City’s social and economic fabric. From small, family-owned restaurants and food carts to four-star world-famous establishments, the city abounds with restaurants that offer cuisines from every corner of the globe. And in 2018 more than 60% of NYC restaurant workers were immigrants, 44% were Hispanic and 20% were Asian. Which means the impact of the pandemic and closure order on restaurants is a blow to the most vulnerable sectors of society. According to Yelp, Chinatowns in major American cities are <a href = "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/covid-19-has-been-a-disaster-for-u-s-chinatowns">performing worse</a> compared to their surrounding metros in January to November 2020. Additionally Womply stated that 59% of independent Chinese restaurants across America have <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/04/21/chinese-restaurants-in-trouble-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak/">ceased operations</a>. These mean that the impact of the pandemic and closure order is a blow to the vulnerable community members.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>

          <p class="lead"> We are using Safegraph Points of Interest weekly foot traffic data from January to June 2020 to map restaurant locations in Manhattan Chinatown, Sunset Park, and Flushing. Additionally, we map selected anti-Asian incidents from the news. We use two analytical methods to understand restaurants’ performance and resiliency:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Performance: number of open restaurants</li>
              <ul>We compare the number of open restaurants in January, March, and June to understand their performance in New York City’s Chinatowns before, during, and after the March 17th restaurant closure order by cuisine group: ‘Chinese’, ‘Other Asian’, and ‘Other’. From the Safegraph data, we define ‘closed’ restaurants as restaurants that had 0 visitors for the first 3 weeks of January and March. Due to data limitations, we used the first two weeks of June and last week of May to identify ‘closed’ restaurants in June. In the bubble diagram, we show the counts in March and June as a percentage of January’s count.</ul>
              <br>
            <li>Resiliency: weekly foot traffic</li>
              <ul>We aggregated the weekly foot traffic data in restaurant businesses in New York City’s Chinatowns between the week of March 16th to June 8th 2020 by cuisine group. We show weekly foot traffic data as a percentage of foot traffic in the week of March 16th, using time-series line charts.</ul>

        <h2>Conclusion: comparative Chinatown study uncovers the nuance in restaurant recovery</h2>
          <p>While at the city level Chinese restaurants in New York City’s main Chinatowns seem to recover as well as other cuisine groups, a comparative study revealed important differences between neighborhoods with some lagging behind.  The difference could be attributed to multiple factors, such as demographic make-up, physical infrastructure, food delivery service presence, the suitability of restaurants’ offerings for take-out, and perhaps sentiment against Asian communities. This opens up future research opportunities to draw a causal relationship from these factors to restaurants’ performance.  A vaccine might put an end to the pandemic, however, business associations, community leaders, urban planners, and policymakers need to work together to save small businesses.</p>
